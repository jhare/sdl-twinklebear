* This repo is a bit different from Twinklebear's setup but not much. I'm doing it by hand from the text. No copy paste, muffuggers.
* for c++11 make sure to supply `-std=c++11`
* make sure to include -Iinclude getResourcePath.h
* I went ahead and did `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-*`, which will grab dev, plus a bunch of shit we don't need
